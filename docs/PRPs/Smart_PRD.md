**# Requirements Document**

**## Introduction**

This feature will transform the existing EHR dashboard application into a SMART on FHIR compliant app that can be embedded and launched directly within the Athena Health EHR system. The integration will enable seamless authentication, patient context sharing, and FHIR-based data exchange while maintaining the current functionality of the dashboard.

**## Requirements**

**### Requirement 1**

- *User Story:** As a healthcare provider using Athena Health EHR, I want to launch the dashboard app directly from within Athena's interface, so that I can access patient data and functionality without leaving my primary workflow.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN a provider clicks the app launch button in Athena THEN the system SHALL initiate a SMART on FHIR launch sequence

2. WHEN the launch sequence is initiated THEN the system SHALL receive and validate the launch parameters from Athena

3. WHEN launch parameters are validated THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate authorization endpoint

4. IF the launch fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and provide troubleshooting guidance

**### Requirement 2**

- *User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the app to automatically authenticate me using my Athena credentials, so that I don't need to log in separately to access the dashboard.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN the SMART launch is initiated THEN the system SHALL use OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE

2. WHEN authorization is successful THEN the system SHALL receive and store access tokens securely

3. WHEN tokens are received THEN the system SHALL validate token scopes match required permissions

4. IF authorization fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options

5. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using refresh tokens

**### Requirement 3**

- *User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the app to automatically load the current patient's data when launched from a patient context in Athena, so that I can immediately view relevant information without manual patient selection.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN launched with patient context THEN the system SHALL extract the patient ID from launch parameters

2. WHEN patient ID is available THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch and display patient data

3. WHEN no patient context is provided THEN the system SHALL display a patient selection interface

4. WHEN patient data is loaded THEN the system SHALL update the UI to show patient-specific information

5. IF patient data cannot be retrieved THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

**### Requirement 4**

- *User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the app to use FHIR APIs to retrieve patient data from Athena, so that I can access standardized, up-to-date clinical information.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN accessing patient data THEN the system SHALL use FHIR R4 API endpoints

2. WHEN making FHIR requests THEN the system SHALL include proper authorization headers with access tokens

3. WHEN FHIR data is received THEN the system SHALL parse and transform it for display in the existing UI components

4. WHEN FHIR requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic and error handling

5. WHEN displaying FHIR data THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing data models and components

**### Requirement 5**

- *User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the app to maintain session state and handle token refresh automatically, so that my workflow isn't interrupted by authentication issues.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN tokens are near expiration THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them in the background

2. WHEN refresh fails THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication

3. WHEN the browser is refreshed THEN the system SHALL restore the session state from secure storage

4. WHEN the app is idle for extended periods THEN the system SHALL handle token expiration gracefully

5. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN the system SHALL synchronize authentication state across tabs

**### Requirement 6**

- *User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the SMART on FHIR app registration details, so that the app can be properly registered and deployed in different Athena environments.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN configuring the app THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific client IDs and redirect URIs

2. WHEN app registration changes THEN the system SHALL validate configuration parameters

3. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL use appropriate FHIR server endpoints

4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation error messages

5. WHEN app metadata is requested THEN the system SHALL serve a valid SMART app manifest

**### Requirement 7**

- *User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the app to handle different launch contexts (patient, encounter, user), so that I can use the app effectively in various clinical scenarios.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN launched in patient context THEN the system SHALL load patient-specific data and workflows

2. WHEN launched in encounter context THEN the system SHALL additionally load encounter-specific information

3. WHEN launched in user-only context THEN the system SHALL provide user-level functionality without patient data

4. WHEN context changes during use THEN the system SHALL update the interface appropriately

5. IF required context is missing THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback behavior

**### Requirement 8**

- *User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the app to support bi-directional data synchronization with Athena Health, so that I can both read patient data and write updates back to the EHR seamlessly.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN reading patient data THEN the system SHALL use Athena's comprehensive API endpoints for administrative, clinical, and financial functions

2. WHEN updating patient information THEN the system SHALL write changes back to athenaOne using appropriate "Write" endpoints

3. WHEN creating clinical documentation THEN the system SHALL finalize notes and send them back to the patient's chart

4. WHEN managing medication lists THEN the system SHALL update patient medication records in athenaOne

5. WHEN processing lab or imaging orders THEN the system SHALL send orders to athenaOne and receive results back into the EHR

**### Requirement 9**

- *User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the app to handle various clinical workflows through Athena's marketplace partner capabilities, so that I can manage patient intake, monitoring, and engagement efficiently.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN processing patient intake data THEN the system SHALL sync intake form data and payments back to athenahealth

2. WHEN monitoring remote patients THEN the system SHALL send vital readings from RPM devices directly to the patient's athenaOne chart

3. WHEN engaging with patients THEN the system SHALL support two-way text messaging synced to the patient record

4. WHEN managing care coordination THEN the system SHALL sync data with external care management platforms

5. WHEN updating patient demographics THEN the system SHALL ensure changes sync back to the patient record in athenaOne

**### Requirement 10**

- *User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the app to meet Athena Health's key requirements for bi-directional write access, so that the integration is approved and maintains compliance standards.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN authenticating with athenahealth THEN the system SHALL implement proper developer authentication to gain API access

2. WHEN handling patient data THEN the system SHALL adhere to HIPAA-compliant security frameworks for data protection during transit and storage

3. WHEN synchronizing data THEN the system SHALL implement proper data mapping to ensure information is written to correct fields in athenaOne

4. WHEN using FHIR standards THEN the system SHALL support HL7 FHIR for interoperability and robust data exchange

5. WHEN processing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL implement encryption, audit logging, and access controls per healthcare regulations

**### Requirement 11**

- *User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the app to maintain security and compliance standards, so that patient data is protected according to healthcare regulations.

**#### Acceptance Criteria**

1. WHEN handling patient data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data in transit using HTTPS

2. WHEN storing tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure browser storage mechanisms

3. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL not log sensitive patient information
