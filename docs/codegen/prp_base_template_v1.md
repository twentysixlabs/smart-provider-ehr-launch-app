## Purpose of this Template

This document provides a standardized Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) template for implementing new features or making significant changes to any codebase. PRPs serve as comprehensive specifications that provide AI coding assistants with sufficient context to implement a feature correctly.

## How to Use This Template

1. Copy this template to create a new PRP
2. Replace the placeholders with your specific implementation details
3. Include sufficient context for each section, referencing existing code paths
4. Be explicit about implementation patterns to follow
5. Include examples where helpful
6. Reference any external documentation, resources, or code patterns
7. Fill out all sections, using "N/A" only when a section truly doesn't apply

### Graceful Degradation

- **Must Work (Critical Path)**: [Core features that must function]
- **Can Degrade (Enhanced Features)**: [Nice-to-have features that can fail gracefully]
- **Fallback Strategies**: [What happens when dependencies fail]

## Observability & Monitoring

[Our stack: Axiom (logs/traces), PostHog (analytics/events)]

### Axiom Logging & Queries

**What to Log**:

- [API endpoint calls with duration]
- [Error events with stack traces]
- [User actions with context (userId, workspaceId)]
- [Performance-critical operations]

**Key Axiom Queries**:

```
[Query name]: [APL query for monitoring this feature]
[Example: "API Latency P95": `['http.request'] | where path == '/api/knowledge/upload' | summarize percentiles(duration, 95) by bin(_time, 5m)`]
```

**Performance Metrics**:

- API latency: p50 <100ms, p95 <500ms, p99 <1s
- [Feature-specific metrics]

### PostHog Events & Analytics

**Events to Track**:
| Event Name | When Triggered | Properties | Purpose |
|------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| [knowledge_base_created] | [User creates knowledge base] | [workspaceId, userId, name] | [Track feature adoption] |
| [document_uploaded] | [File upload completes] | [fileType, fileSize, duration] | [Monitor upload success rate] |

**Feature Flags** (if applicable):

- [Flag name]: [Purpose and rollout strategy]
- [Example: `knowledge_management_v2`]: Enable new search UI for 10% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%

**User Behavior Metrics**:

- [Conversion rate for this feature]
- [Time to complete key workflows]
- [Error rate per user action]

### Slack Alerts

**Alert Conditions**:
| Alert Name | Trigger | Severity | Channel | Response Time |
|------------|---------|----------|---------|---------------|
| [High error rate] | [>5% errors in 5min] | [Critical] | [#alerts-prod] | [Immediate] |
| [Slow API] | [P95 >2s for 10min] | [Warning] | [#alerts-prod] | [Next business day] |

**Alert Template**:

```
ðŸš¨ [Feature Name] Alert
Metric: [Metric name]
Current Value: [Value]
Threshold: [Threshold]
Runbook: [Link to incident response doc]
```

## Deployment Strategy

[Our stack: Vercel auto-deploy (dev â†’ staging â†’ production), PostHog feature flags]

### Feature Flag Configuration

**Flag Setup** (PostHog):

```typescript
// Flag name: [feature_name_v1]
// Description: [What this flag controls]
// Rollout strategy:
{
  enabled: true,
  rolloutPercentage: 10, // Start at 10%
  filters: {
    // Optional: Target specific users/workspaces
    workspaceId: ['workspace-123'] // Beta testers
  }
}
```

**Gradual Rollout Plan**:

1. **10% Rollout** (Day 1): Internal team + beta customers
   - Monitor: Error rates, performance, user feedback
   - Success criteria: <1% error rate, positive feedback
2. **50% Rollout** (Day 2-3): Half of users
   - Monitor: Same metrics at scale
   - Success criteria: Metrics stable, no critical bugs
3. **100% Rollout** (Day 4+): All users
   - Monitor: Continue monitoring for 1 week

### Deployment Checklist

**Pre-Deploy**:

- [ ] Code merged to `main` branch (triggers Vercel deploy)
- [ ] Feature flag created in PostHog (default: OFF)
- [ ] Staging deployment tested (automatic)
- [ ] Production deploy completed (automatic)

**Post-Deploy**:

- [ ] Enable feature flag for internal team (1%)
- [ ] Monitor Axiom for errors (15 minutes)
- [ ] Check PostHog for event tracking
- [ ] Verify Slack alerts are configured

### Rollback Procedure

**When to Rollback**:

- Error rate >5% for this feature
- Critical bug affecting user data
- Performance degradation (P95 >2x baseline)
- User-reported blocker issues

**Rollback Steps**:

1. **Immediate**: Disable feature flag in PostHog (takes effect instantly)
2. **If flag disable insufficient**: Git revert + redeploy
   ```bash
   git revert [commit-hash]
   git push origin main
   # Vercel auto-deploys to staging â†’ production
   ```
3. **Database migrations** (if applicable): Convex handles forward-only migrations
   - If rollback needed: Deploy fix forward, don't revert schema
4. **Communication**: Post in #engineering Slack about rollback

## Security & Compliance Checkpoint

[Required for healthcare/HIPAA features]

### PHI Handling Checklist

**Does this feature handle PHI (Protected Health Information)?**

- [ ] Yes â†’ Complete security review (required)
- [ ] No â†’ Standard review sufficient

**If YES, ensure**:

- [ ] All PHI is encrypted at rest (Convex handles this)
- [ ] All PHI is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
- [ ] PHI is never logged to Axiom (mask sensitive data)
- [ ] Access is workspace-scoped (multi-tenant isolation)
- [ ] Audit logging is in place (who accessed what PHI, when)

### Security Review Triggers

**Requires Security Review if**:

- [ ] Handles PHI (patient data, medical records)
- [ ] New authentication/authorization logic
- [ ] External API integrations (third-party services)
- [ ] File uploads (potential for malicious files)
- [ ] User-generated content (XSS risk)

**Security Checklist**:

- [ ] Input validation (frontend + backend)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (use parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitize user input)
- [ ] CSRF protection (Next.js handles this)
- [ ] Rate limiting (prevent abuse)

### Compliance Considerations

**HIPAA Requirements**:

- [ ] Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place for third-party services
- [ ] Audit trail for PHI access (log all reads/writes)
- [ ] Secure data deletion process (when user requests)
- [ ] Incident response plan documented

**Data Retention**:

- [How long is data stored?]
- [Deletion policy when user cancels?]
- [Backup retention period?]

## Technical Debt & Future Work

[Be honest about trade-offs and what's deferred]

### Known Compromises (Ship Now, Fix Later)

**Shortcuts Taken**:

- [Trade-off 1]: [Why taken] â†’ [Fix by: Date/Phase]
- [Example: "Using in-memory cache instead of Redis"]: [Keep it simple for MVP] â†’ [Add Redis in Phase 2]

**Refactoring Needed**:

- [Code smell 1]: [Impact] â†’ [Refactor priority: Low/Medium/High]
- [Example: "Duplicated logic in 3 files"]: [Harder to maintain] â†’ [High: Refactor in 2 weeks]

**Scalability Limits**:

- [Current capacity]: [Number of users/requests]
- [Breaking point]: [When will this not scale?]
- [Plan]: [How to address before we hit the limit]

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for This PRP)

**Phase 2 Features** (Intentionally Deferred):

- [Feature 1]: [Why deferred] â†’ [Target: Q2 2025]
- [Example: "Advanced search filters"]: [MVP has basic search] â†’ [Add after user feedback]

**Nice-to-Haves** (Didn't Make the Cut):

- [Feature 1]: [Why not included]
- [Example: "Dark mode"]: [Low priority, focus on core value first]

**Optimization Opportunities**:

- [Performance optimization 1]: [Current: 2s, Target: 500ms] â†’ [When: After load testing]
- [Example: "Lazy load images"]: [Current: Load all, Target: On-demand] â†’ [Phase 2]

### Tech Debt Tracking (Informal)

[Capture for future reference, even if not formally tracked]

**Add to "Tech Debt" Notion Board**:

- [ ] [Debt item 1]: [Impact + Effort estimate]
