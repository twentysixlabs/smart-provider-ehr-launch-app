## Certification Timeline

### Parallel Approach (Recommended)

Start all three certifications simultaneously:

```
Week 1-4:   Register all three vendors, begin sandbox testing
Week 5-8:   Complete sandbox tests, submit for review
Week 9-16:  Address vendor feedback, iterate
Week 17-24: Production approvals, deploy

Total: 6 months
```

### Sequential Approach

Do one vendor at a time:

```
Epic:   Weeks 1-8
Cerner: Weeks 9-14
Athena: Weeks 15-22

Total: 5-6 months
```
